# Effective limits on single scalar extensions in the light of recent LHC data

This repository presents the supplementary material of the article [arxiv:2111.05876](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05876).

The matching results for 16 single scalar extensions of the SM including both pure heavy and heavy-light mixed Wilson coefficients in Warsaw and SILH bases are present in  models.nb file.

Solid blue (dashed red/green) constant-probability-contours enclose the 68% and dot-dashed blue (dotted red/green) ones enclose the 95% credible regions, respectively. Coloured regions (blue/red/green) with variable density depict the high probability regions.
2D plot files are named as {model name}_ {parameter_1}_ {parameter_2}.

In 1D plots, median and 68% credible intervals are shown for point estimates, alongwith the histogram and PDF.
